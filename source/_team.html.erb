        <h1>Our Team</h1>
        <p>
          It's pretty much just me! I do have a regular team of people that I
          call on to help with particular aspects of a project, though, since
          one person can't provide for every specialisation. I can source
          &mdash; and manage &mdash; extra developers, designers, and site
          reliability engineers, depending on the needs of the project.

          <h4><span class="navy">Graeme</span> Mathieson</h4>
          <p>
            I've been developing web applications with the Ruby on Rails
            framework for over a decade now (something that not many people can
            claim!). Prior to that, I was building web apps in Python, and
            before that I was building embedded C++ code for Voice over IP
            gateways.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to Ruby, I've got a fair chunk of experience with
            JavaScript, and with managing the platforms we deploy apps onto
            (the cool kids call this bit DevOps). I've got a BEng (Hons) in
            Software Engineering from the University of Edinburgh and an AAT
            Diploma in Accounting (don't ask).
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not in the office, staring at a sea of code, I really
            enjoy a spot of indoor rock climbing. You can often find me hanging
            around the local climbing wall, trying to conquer my latest
            project!
