    We’re exploring tools & technologies that will allow people to measure,
    manage & improve their mental wellbeing. We’re performing experiments that
    allow us to better understand ourselves and our surrounding environment, so
    that we can figure out what makes us truly happy!

    Right now, we're looking for people with an interest in improving their
    mental wellbeing to help us shape these tools. Would you be willing to help
    out?

    A Sneak Peek at The Internet will take you on a deep dive through the
    network stack, from HTTP, SSL, TCP and IP, all the way down through the
    data link layer, back up to Facebook's data centres, and the return journey
    back to the browser.

    I want to go on a holistic exploration of how developers write code in a
    sustainable, enjoyable way. I want to hear about their physical
    environment; the tools they use for development; the SaaS apps they use to
    make their lives easier; the productivity methodologies they subscribe to;
    how they balance work and life; and what they do when they're not at the
    computer.

    I think that documenting this bigger picture will give us a greater insight
    into what makes for an awesome developer, how we can lead more sustainable
    lives, and how these people tick.

    I'd like to keep track of my indoor rock climbing. In particular, I'd like
    to know if my performance is improving, or if it has plateaued (pun
    intended!). I've got a bit of a system for keeping track, and I'd like to
    extend it so that other people can participate, too. I reckon there's a
    tonne of potential for gamifying things here!

    But that's just the start. With an Apple Watch strapped to your wrist, or
    an iPhone (securely!) pocketed away, I think we can collect a pile of
    useful metrics about your climbing automatically. There's the iOS motion
    sensors, and there's iBeacon indoor location; I think the combo could
    automagically track your climbs, **and provide feedback on your
    technique**.
