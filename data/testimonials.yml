    Graeme acted as a technical consultant to Sourcerail, providing me with
    essential guidance and backup. The breadth and depth of his technical and
    commercial experience allowed him to guide us to the correct technical and
    business solutions to the challenges we faced while developing the
    application.

    Working with Graeme was an absolute pleasure.

    I did some Ruby on Rails development work for Graeme recently, which was
    both a pleasure and an education. Graeme is one of those rare guys that
    is as comfortable talking to clients and interpreting their needs as he
    is coding the solutions to meet those needs. He knows Rails inside out
    but, more importantly, he also knows how best to use it to deliver great
    results for his clients. I learned a great deal from him during the
    project.

    It's rare enough to find someone that's good at one role, but Graeme
    somehow manages to be both an awesome technical lead and a great project
    manager. He has a wealth of experience and an ability to communicate both
    at a high level -- which makes it easy for non-technical people to
    understand -- and with the attention to detail that geeks crave. Any
    project that involves Graeme is going to be a massive success and a lot of
    fun.

    His rich knowledge of Ruby on Rails, systems architecture and the Internet
    in general, combined with his practical and pragmatic approach, kept the
    delivery team relaxed and productive. This enabled us to successfully
    deliver a large system from a hugely complex set of constantly evolving
    requirements.

    Highly recommended. I really enjoy working with Graeme. He is extremely
    good at what he does. He is very trustworthy, his code is of impeccable
    quality, and, for most programming tasks, he is fast - very fast. He
    probably thinks and types twice as fast as me! If these are qualities that
    you are looking for, especially trust and quality, then he is very good
    value for money.

    Azalea Innovations has used Graeme on a number of occassions, most usually
    to fix mission critical issues that we simply cannot handle in-house. Each
    and every time we are impressed with how he just gets on with it, makes
    things work and calms everyone down in the process.

    Graeme is clearly one of those people who just understands what needs to be
    done. Working with incomplete, inconsistent, and often incoherent briefs,
    Graeme keeps his cool and works his magic.

    We simply cannot recommend him highly enough.
